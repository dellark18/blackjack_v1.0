HOW TO PLAY:
Each player draws a card by clicking "START GAME" and for each round, player draws two cards which are summed together. When a player draws total of "21" then the player wins. Cards sum less than 21 will prompt the player to try again but when the score is above 21 you're shown a prompt that says "you're out of the game"
